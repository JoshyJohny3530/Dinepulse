# DinePulse Mobile App

# Flutter App
For the 2nd Sprint, we implemented Order taking Mobile Application, which includes these processes : 
- This mobile application is mainly for use by order taking staffs and admin.
-	Firstly, there will be a Login screen for the Staff
-	After login, by clicking the navigation drawer, staff can look through different navigation menu for easy access of the screens.
-	Dine-in and Take-away orders are accepting through this waitron  mobile application.
-	After Login, Staff can view tables and its availability. For dine-in, can reserve a table by selecting table number and number of customers.
-	After this, staff can take orders by filtering menu items via category.
-	Add products to cart by choosing the quantity of the item and at the final screen, shows the entire orders and by clicking the confirm order button, order details will be sent to the Kitchen and the next steps will be processed from Admin Dashboard. So, we are handling both Mobile application and admin dashboard functionalities parallelly.
